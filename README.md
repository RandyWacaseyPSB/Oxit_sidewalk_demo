# Oxit_sidewalk_demo
sidewalk demo hardware from oxit

RW 04012025 - updated platformio.ini to allow for serial monitor in VScode.  Note that a reset of the board is required to use the built in terminal (button closest to the USB port).  Otherwise the terminal will state a user side exception about not opening the port.
